## Fork info

Done by SandPoot, this is an attempt of making this work better.

SPLURT info: Fork made just so we can add ourselves to this lol

## Compiling for testing

Requirements:
Python 3.6+?
All the libraries in requirements.txt

Compilation steps:

1. Start a python environment using `py -m venv [path to your environment folder]`
2. Enter such environment by running `[path to your environment folder]\Scripts\activate.bat`
3. Run build.bat

## Installation

Download the installer [here](https://github.com/SPLURT-Station/ss13rp/raw/master/dist/install.exe) and run it. If you don't trust me, because no one seems to, compile it yourself. You could use something like pyinstaller.
